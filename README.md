# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Orange-Data-Mining

Overview
DiabAI-Orange is a no-code machine learning project built using Orange Data Mining to predict diabetes risk from medical data. The workflow includes:

* Data preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, outlier removal)

* Exploratory analysis (distributions, correlations, feature importance)

* Model training & evaluation (Random Forest, SVM, kNN, etc.)

* Image-based diagnosis (retinal scans for diabetic retinopathy)

Key Results:

✅ 97.8% accuracy (Random Forest on tabular data)

✅ 89.4% accuracy (Logistic Regression on image data)
